This Cevelop project contains an example implementation for P0052 scope guards and unique_resource.

The src directory contains the source code (c) 2016-2017 Eric Niebler and Peter Sommerlad and is available under the MIT license.

The cute directory contains the CUTE unit testing library currently under LGPLv3 (we plan to change that to MIT license as well).
